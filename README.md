# RockPaperScissors
This project will be about a simple rock paper scissors games made using javascript, running on the console() (temporarily)

I'll be using this opportunity to showcase what set of skills I've aquired in JS so far, be it data types, variable, functions, conditionals, but most importantly how I go about solving the problem at hand like a programmer should, by planning and applying, and also debugging any potential errors or mistakes.
